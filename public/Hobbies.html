<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<h2>Music</h2>

<p>
    I've been obsessed with music my whole life. This lead
    to me picking up a guitar and starting a band in my teens.
    Unfortunately, it didn't last, but I still play and sing
    as much as possible with anyone I can find who wants to 
    join in.

<h2>Karate</h2>

<p>
    I began training in karate in university and kept it up
    for many years after, reaching the rank of first dan.
    It taught me a mindset of perseverance and improvement
    that I try to bring into all aspects of my life.

<h2>Languages</h2>

<p>
    I love learning about different cultures, and to do that
    properly, you need to learn their language. A process I 
    find very enjoyable, eventually leading to me moving to
    Spain to get closer to the language and to hopefully
    reach a high level of proficiency. I also have a deep love
    for the Japanese language which I've studied on and off
    since I was a teenager.
