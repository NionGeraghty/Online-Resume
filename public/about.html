<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I studied computer engineering in Trinity College Dublin,
   primarily using C++ in a large variety of projects, 
   After which, I took a break from programming to pursue other
interests. Now I'm returning to the field and studying 
web development with the hope of finding work in that area. </p>

  I also have many hobbies which you can read about here: <br/>
